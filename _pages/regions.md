# Region page

This page will show the same volume evolution as for individual glaciers, but for larger regions (e.g. Alps, HMA, global). Or even all glacier regions with a map showing where they are located.

Are you further interested in the future of glaciers? You can discover their future projected evolution from the following resources: 
- [OGGM-edu: global and regional glacier projections from PyGEM-OGGM for 1.5°C–4.0°C](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/global_future_glacier-app_rounce_delta_T_en.html)
- [OGGM-edu: Alpine and alpine country-wide glacier projections from PyGEM-OGGM for 1.5°C–4.0°C](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/alps_future-app_rounce_delta_T_en.html)
- PROVIDE climate risk dashboard where glacier projections can be selected for every country with glaciers: [link to glacier projections for Austria under 1.5°C and 2020 climate policies scenarios](https://climate-risk-dashboard.climateanalytics.org/impacts/explore?indicator=glacier-volume&geography=AUT&scenarios[0]=curpol&time=annual&reference=present-day-2020&spatial=area)
- Additional most recent information on the *Cryosphere* (ice sheets, glaciers, snow, permafrost, sea ice and polar oceans) are available from the *State of the Cryosphere Report 2024*: https://iccinet.org/statecryo24/
  - "The report describes how a combination of melting polar ice sheets, vanishing glaciers, and thawing permafrost will have rapid, irreversible, and disastrous impacts worldwide."
